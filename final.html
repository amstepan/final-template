			<p>Syracuse has completed its first regular season under head coach Fran Brown and the Orange are 9-3. The biggest jump between last year’s squad and the 2024 group was its offense. Quarterback Kyle McCord transferred from Ohio State and led the nation in passing, helping SU to a much improved offensive unit.</p>

            <p>Beyond McCord’s torrid stretch, Syracuse’s offense was prolific across the board. In order to calculate how each individual on the offense performed beyond the simple counting numbers, we can look to Pro Football Focus. The football analytics service grades each player in the nation on -2 to +2 scale, converting the grade to a tangible 0-100 scale to make it more digestible to consumers.  It also keeps track of every snap, allowing usage to be seen.</p>

            <p>“We try to do the impossible task of grading every single player on every single play in every single game. The best play you could possibly make on a single play you get a +2 score. The worst play’s a -2,” PFF analyst Max Chadwick said.</p>

            <p>Here’s how SU’s offense stacked up in 2024 according to PFF: </p>


			<h1> SU Receiver Corps</h1>

			<p>In 2023, Syracuse’s passing offense was unimpressive. The Orange totaled just 171 passing yards per game, the least in the Atlantic Coast Conference. SU had just two receivers notch 400 or more receiving yards, according to <a href="https://cuse.com/sports/football/stats/2023" target="_blank">cuse.com. </a> </p>

			<p> This offseason, the Orange upgraded their receiving core. Syracuse returned redshirt junior Trebor Peña following a season-ending injury and added two Georgia transfers in Jackson Meeks and Zeed Haynes. </p>

			<p> Haynes missed most of the season to a personal matter but with Peña and Meeks leading the charge, and McCord slinging it to them, the unit became one of the top in the country. Peña has the most total snaps among SU wide receivers with 750 but Meeks has been the most effective, grading at a 78.10 for offense grade per PFF. </p>

			<p> “They’re top 10 in receiving grade in the country right now. So what they've done this year is outstanding,” Chadwick said of the receiving corps. </p>

			<p> Overall, the unit’s excelled with those two leading the charge along with the standout play of Justus Ross-Simmons and Darrell Gill Jr. Peña’s 76.7 offense grade ranks behind Meeks while Ross-Simmons posted a 64.3 and Gill a 61.2. SU totaled 4,357 receiving yards this season, the most in the nation and 2,134 more than a year ago. </p>

			<h1> Running back usage </h1>
			
			<p> Running back LeQuint Allen Jr. entered 2024 as one of the only returners to Syracuse’s offensive unit. As a sophomore in 2023, he eclipsed the 1,000 rushing yards mark on the ground. </p>

			<p> While the transfer of McCord meant utilizing the rushing game less, Allen Jr.’s overall usage among running backs increased. Syracuse brought in transfer Will Nixon from Washington and freshman Yasin Willis to be the next great SU running back. Still, it was Allen Jr. carrying the load.</p>

            <p> He recorded 80% of snaps among running backs with 216 snaps in the running game. Freshman Yasin Willis starred in the backup role, seeing just under 12% of snaps.</p>

			<p> Allen Jr.’s prowess and nack to find the end zone made him a key piece to Syracuse’s offense once again. He ranked third on the offense with a grade of 81.5, trailing only McCord and tight end Oronde Gadsden II. Despite less 34 less carries than 2023, Allen Jr. found the end zone a career-high 14 times, delivering big for the Orange in multiple clutch moments.</p>

			<p> Brown’s repeatedly leaned on Allen Jr., especially when it’s mattered most.</p>

			<p> “In overtime, that’s LeQuint time,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXDWNVv4cic" target="_blank">Fran Brown said following SU’s win over Virginia Tech on Nov. 2. </a> “Just get LeQuint the ball." </p>

			<h1>New Jersey connections </h1>
			
			<p> One of Fran Brown’s biggest successes thus far at Syracuse has been recruiting the northeast region. A Camden, New Jersey native, Brown has excelled in recruiting his home state and is increasingly bringing top talent from N.J. and New York to the 3-1-5.</p>

			<p> In breaking down what state SU’s offense is from, it’s clear Brown’s already made an impact in year one. New Jersey leads Syracuse's offense with 27% of the players to record an offensive snap coming from the Garden State. Most notably, it’s their top players coming from N.J. McCord, Allen Jr. and Peña all come from Brown’s state and rank in the top five for SU’s offense per PFF.</p>

			<p> Brown has additional New Jersey athletes throughout the roster including defensive backs Alijah Clark and Duce Chestnut and edge rusher Fadil Diggs among others. </p>

" /></noscript></div>

			<h1>Offensive line performance </h1>
	
			<p>No offense is strong without a durable offensive line. Syracuse cycled in 12 different players to round its offensive line, using multiple players at each position to keep them fresh. </p>

			<p> When looking at the unit, the average grades for pass blocking and run blocking are extremely similar, as the pass blocking grade is just 1% better than the run blocking. The guard position specifically shows the biggest differentiation with a 24% better pass protection grade than run protection. Chadwick credits this discrepancy, especially for a position on the interior, to the rest of SU’s offense. </p>

			<p> “I think they're able to mask the offensive line's deficiencies by getting rid of the football so fast,” Chadwick said. “And then also by the fact that they're not really running the ball that much either.” </p>

			<p> On passing plays, tackle David Wohlabaugh Jr. recorded an 82.8 grade, the highest on the team. Syracuse’s unit overall has been worrisome. However, the accomplishment of keeping McCord healthy was tremendous. He became the first SU quarterback to play all 12 regular season games since 2012, and a big reason was the Orange offensive line. Still, in a strong offense, the stars usually get the credit.</p>

			<p> “The offensive line was not the strength of this offense,” Chadwick said. “It was pretty obvious this year Syracuse is a very star-driven offense.” </p>

			<h1>Overall improvement </h1>

			<p> A three-win improvement from 2023-24 goes largely to Syracuse’s offensive unit. It has seen an over 31% increase in its overall offense grade and a 70% increase on its passing grade from its full season, 13 game 2023 totals. </p> 

			<p> The Orange finished the regular season with the 14th highest grade offense (85.7) and 9th best passing game (87.2), catapulting SU into the College Football Playoff Top 25. </p>
 
			<p> “I do think the biggest reason for Syracuse's success this year has got to be getting a star quarterback like Kyle McCord. He’s one of the best quarterbacks in America, in my opinion, this year. And a big reason for why Syracuse is so good,” Chadwick said.</p>
